# CCLE-R-analysis
This code performs t-tests between three gene expression matrices, head and neck cancer (HNSCC), esophageal cancer (ESO), and lung cancer (LUNG). The code first reads in the CSV files containing the gene expression data and removes the first 9 columns from each CSV file. The code then converts each CSV file to a numeric matrix.
